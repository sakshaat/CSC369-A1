# CSC369-A1 System Call Hijacker
A Linux kernel module written in C that can hijack specific system calls from the system calls table and log a message every time a hijacked system call is called.

I developed this as part of my evaluation for CSC369 at University of Toronto in order to demonstrate in-depth knowledge of C and kernel module development, achieving a score of 98% on the assignment.
