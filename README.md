# CSC369-A1 System Call Hijacker
A Linux kernel module written in C that can hijack specific system calls from the system calls table and log a message every time a hijacked system call is called. I created this as part of my evaluation for the course in order to demonstrate in-depth knowledge of C and low-level software kernel development by achieving a score of 98% on this assignment.
